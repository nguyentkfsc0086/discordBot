This is a small project I tried with Discord library in Python

How to use this?
1. Clone this repo into your machine
``` HTML
  git clone https://github.com/nguyentkfsc0086/discordBot
```
2. Change the reward and the condition based on your own server
3. Create your own bot on discord
4. Replace the parameter inside bot.run('') by your bot token
5. Use this command to allowed Python to run in
   Replace 3.11 by your Python version
   ```HTML
   /Applications/Python\ 3.11/Install\ Certificates.command
6. Run the file, you can keep it on your machine or use third party host service to run it
